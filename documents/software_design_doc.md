## Section 1 | Introduction

This personal website [[https://williealcaraz.dev](https://williealcaraz.dev)],  is an endeavor dedicated to the creation of a personal portfolio website with multifaceted objectives. Our initiative is aimed towards creating a personal portfolio website that may be viewed by employers, allow for a landing page for quick contact information exchange, serves as a project for a continuously growing skillset, and much more. 

In the current competitive landscape where growth requires proof of skill, we recognize the need for a method of showing acquired skill sets and efficient practice with purpose. This project intends to reflect on commitment to personal and professional development.


### 1.1 Project Objectives

The primary purpose of this personal website project is to create a personal website that will showcase personal and professional growth in the industry of choice, presented in a well-created website. This website shall also serve as a quick and effective means of obtaining contact information when requested via QR / NFC scan, or simply by navigation within the website.


#### 1.1.1 Showcasing 


    The website is designed to exhibit the creator’s skills, professional accomplishments, and provide a comprehensive overview of experiences, qualifications, and other factors that are of interest when seeking information about the individual.


### 1.2 Scope of Work

The scope of work of this website consists of several elements to ensure a smooth and clean website with an efficient purpose. Execution of this plan will entail several elements, such as specific programming languages, formatting, frameworks, and other methods required by the content design.


#### 1.2.1 Content Strategy


    Content will be presented in a professional and visually appealing manner to influence viewing of additional content on the website. There will be some form of an “About Me” section along with photographs of experiences will be included to familiarize the visitor with the outcomes of current exceptional achievements, including those not involving the industry. Contact information will be presented in a way that it will be easily accessible.


#### 1.2.2 Design / Layout


    The website will have a clean layout, initially presented with a title of the person’s name and title upon entrance of the website. A photo of the individual will be presented as well, where the “About Me” section will reside. This section will contain information about the individual, achievements, and other necessary details followed by a photo gallery to better elaborate on the field of work of the individual’s achievements. Lastly, the contact information will reside at the bottom of the website, presenting email, LinkedIn links, as well as a link to the Resume / CV document. \
Additionally, a landing page will be created to allow for a quick and effective way of exchanging contact information when presented with a QR code or NFC scan to the website. The subdirectory will be located in `/scan`


#### 1.2.3 Functionality, Performance Optimization


    Implementing essential functionalities, such as a contact section or form for inquiries, and dynamic sections for adding / removing information as necessary. Optimization will include proper dynamic layouts for both desktop (i.e. Chrome, Safari, FireFox, Edge) as well as mobile (iOS, Android) regardless of screen size ensuring the website loads quickly and functions smoothly across all platforms.


### 1.3 Expected Outcome

Successful completion of all elements of this website will anticipate the following outcomes:



* Visual Appeal
    * The website will look professional and, most importantly, _clean_, and effectively communicate an introduction about the owner in a minimal, but efficient way.
* Visibility / Accessibility
    * Increased visibility and accessibility to potential employers, collaborators, community, and any other applicable persons.
* Design Feedback and Project Growth 
    * Seek feedback on the website’s usability, design, and functionality with the intent of improvements as this is a growing project reflecting on the creator’s growth and ability to adapt and make adjustments. Features and changes will constantly be added to adapt to requirements as well as implementing features focusing on user experience.


## Section 2 | Scope of Work
